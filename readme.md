# Platform-Independent AutoIt3 Interpreter

AutoIt is a traditionally Windows-only scripting language based on the Visual Basic syntax.
The aim of this repository is to provide an AutoIt3 Interpreter for other platforms, such as Linux/Unix and MacOS. This Interpreter is based purely on .NET8-conform C#/F# code and primarily supports the AutoIt3-specification.
The Interpreter does support a plugin-based extension system in order to provide a custom syntax or framework functionality to the interpreter.

> [!NOTE]
> This repository contains a newer (.NET8-based) **extensible AutoIt3 Interpreter** based on a previous version of this project.
> In order to see the "old" **AutoIt++ Interpiler** written in 2018 (discontinued), refer to the following URL: https://github.com/Unknown6656/AutoIt-Interpreter-old.
